/**
 * Instructions:
 * Write a solution in Node.JS:
 *
 * How your implementation works:
 * Your function will take two arguments, (prevArray, currArray), flattens the objects inside of prevArray and currArray to 1 level of
 * depth, and returns an HTML Table of the values.  The HTML table you return has a column header which is a superset of all keys in 
 * all the objects in the currArray.  Any values that have changed from the prevArray to the currArray (ie field value changed or is a 
 * new key altogether) should be bolded. In the case that the value has been removed altogether from the prevArray to the currArravy, 
 * you will write out the key in bold DELETED.
 * 
 * Rules:
 * 1. The arrays are arbitrarily deep (see common questions for explanation of arbitrarily deep).
 * 2. The currArray could have more or potentially even be in a different index order.  You cannot depend solely on array index for  
 * comparison.  However, you can assume that each object in the arrays will have an "_id" parameter.  Unless the currArray has no  
 * object with the matching "_id" parameter (for example if the whole row has changed).
 * 3. Do not create global scope.  We have a test runner that will iterate on your function and run many fixtures through it.  If you 
 * create global scope for 1 individual diff between prevArray to currArray you could cause other tests to fail.  
 *
 * Common Questions:
 * 1. Can I use outside packages to solve (e.g. NPM, Bower)?  Yes.  You can use any packages you want to solve the solution.  
 * 2. Can I use google or outside resources (e.g. StackOverflow, GitHub)?  Yes.  Act as you would in your day job.
 * 3. What does arbitrarily deep mean? The prevArray or currArray can have objects inside of objects at different levels of depth. 
 *    You will not know how many levels of depth the objects could have, meaning your code must handle any kind of object.  Your 
 *    solution  must account for this.  Do not assume the examples below are the only fixtures we will use to test your code. 
 * 
 * @param prevArray is an array of objects
 * @param currArray is an array of objects
 * @return a string with HTML markup in it, should return null if error occurs.
